Check out some of my projects!<br>

<strong>Lumboard</strong></a> - The main purpose of Lumboard is to help users text more<br>
quickly and easily. It provides the comfort of spelling out words that<br>
are usually shortened, all with the tap of one key. The keyboard's design<br>
was inspired by Matias Duarte's Material Design. This application was<br>
built at the University of Waterloo at Hack The North.<br>

<a href="https://github.com/brandonio/NASA-Telemetry-Filter"><strong>DSAC Telemetry Filter
</strong></a> - This program is used to filter out data packets<br>
from the Deep Space Atomic Clock that fit into a user-selected range. It<br>
then prints out these packets to a spreadsheet. I wrote this as I learned to<br>
code during my internship at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as part of its<br>
Summer High School Internship Program under NASA's Minority<br>
University Research and Education Program.<br><br>
